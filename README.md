# Shady Meadows Automation Tests

This project contains an example implementation of the **Page Object + component model** to automate a small end‑to‑end booking flow on the [`automationintesting.online`](https://automationintesting.online) demo site.  The goal of this work sample is to illustrate how to structure test automation using playwright automation

## Getting started

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```sh
   npm install
   # optional: install browser binaries used by Playwright
   npx playwright install 
   yarn install
   ```

   The first command installs the JavaScript dependencies defined in `package.json`.  The second downloads a copy of Chromium (as well as Firefox/WebKit if desired) so the tests can run in a deterministic environment without relying on whatever browser happens to be installed locally.Third installs yarn

2. **Run the tests**

   ```sh
   yarn test
   ```

   This will execute the Playwright test suite located under the `tests/` directory.  The default configuration runs all tests headlessly against the Chromium browser.  You can override the browser or enable headed mode by passing flags directly to Playwright, for example:

   ```sh
   yarn test --headed
   ```

3. **Lint the code (optional)**

   ESLint can help catch common mistakes and enforce consistent style.  Run:

   ```sh
   yarn lint
   to fix them - yarn lint --fix
   ```

## GitHub Actions CI

An example GitHub Actions workflow is included under `.github/workflows/playwright.yml`.  It installs dependencies, downloads the necessary Playwright browsers and runs the tests on every push and pull request.  


## Known limitations

The demo application occasionally suffers from client‑side errors that cause the page to crash when submitting a reservation.  The test suite assumes the application behaves as expected and asserts on a “Booking Confirmed” message.  If the application fails, the test will report a failure.  In a real‑world scenario you would implement retry logic or network interception to make your tests resilient to such flakiness.
